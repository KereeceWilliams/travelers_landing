  <h2> What is Drone Technology? </h2>
  <br>
  <p> Drones are used in situations where manned flight is considered too risky or difficult. They provide troops with a 24-hour "eye in the sky", seven days a week. Each aircraft can stay aloft for up to 17 hours at a time, loitering over an area and sending back real-time imagery of activities on the ground. The insurance market has now made a way into the market for Drone technology. They have found a way. </p>
  <p> That ease and mobility means plenty of opportunities for testing, and Swain said catastrophe situations are the perfect entry point for USAA into commercial drones based on the need. USAAâ€™s second exemption, granted April 8, permits the organization to do that. In the event of a situation where the volume of claims to USAA from a specific area might be high, the company can send a PrecisionHawk Lancaster drone to collect images and data. </p>
